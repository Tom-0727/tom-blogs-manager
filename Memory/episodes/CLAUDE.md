# Memory/episodes/

Bounded execution records for Tom-Blogs-Manager.

**You MUST read this file before creating or updating any episode.**

## Keep Episode Files Concise

The episode file is the durable, decision-relevant record — **not** the place where full execution context flows. Detailed planning briefings and detailed evaluation reasoning are passed between the main agent and its subagents (`episode-planner`, `episode-evaluator`) via prompts and return values, not by dumping them here. Put only what the agent itself will need when reading this episode back later.

## Unit of Record

`One episode = one bounded work cycle with a direct objective and a judgeable outcome`

Valid examples:
- A first market sizing attempt
- A retry after discovering low-trust sources
- A synthesis pass consolidating evidence into a memo

Invalid boundaries:
- A single shell command
- A calendar day
- An entire multi-day project

Quick test — can you answer all of these?
1. What am I trying to achieve right now?
2. What context am I relying on?
3. What did I try?
4. What was the outcome?

If yes, the boundary is likely correct.

## Tasks and Episodes

- `task`: An agent-defined unit of execution derived from a broader goal. A task may span multiple episodes.
- `episode`: A bounded attempt within a task.

Rules:
- `task` is the semantic grouping key
- `time` is the storage key
- `episode` is the replay and learning key
- Each episode has exactly one `task_id`

## Directory Structure

```
episodes/
  YYYY/
    MM/
      ep--<started_at_utc>--<domain>--<slug>.md
```

Store chronologically, group by metadata, path stability over semantic nesting.

## File Naming

Format: `ep--<started_at_utc>--<domain>--<slug>.md`

- `started_at_utc`: `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`
- `domain`: coarse-grained namespace
- `slug`: short summary of the attempt

## Frontmatter (required)

Every episode must begin with this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: ep.<started_at_utc>.<domain>.<slug>
task_id: task.<domain>.<task-slug>
domain: <domain>
title: Human-readable episode label
objective: One sentence describing what "done" looks like. Qualitative criteria are fine — you do not need to quantify.
status: completed | failed   # omit at creation; set only at the terminal state
eval_rounds: 0
last_edited_at: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

Status meaning:
- `completed` — the evaluator returned PASS for this episode's objective.
- `failed` — the evaluator returned FAIL after the 3-round soft cap, or execution hit an unrecoverable blocker.

An episode file with no `status` field is mid-flight and not authoritative. The planner creates the file without `status`; the main agent writes it at the end of the heartbeat when the outcome is decided.

`eval_rounds` is the counter for the per-episode evaluator retry cap. It starts at 0 and is incremented every time the main agent re-invokes the evaluator for this episode.

## Body Template

```markdown
## Objective

One sentence describing what "done" looks like for this episode. Qualitative criteria are fine — you do not need to quantify.

## Context Snapshot

- Key assumptions
- Prior episode IDs
- Relevant knowledge or constraints

## Actions Taken

- Action 1
- Action 2
- Action 3

## Key Evidence

- Evidence that changed decisions

## Outcome

- Result
- Status explanation
- Output summary

## Reflection

- What worked
- What failed
- What changed my thinking
- What should be reused or avoided

## Follow-up Actions

- Suggested next episode
- Candidates for promotion to knowledge/skill
```

## Compression

Episodes store decision-relevant information, not raw output.

**Include**: decisive observations, important commands/files/URLs, contradictory evidence, failure points, reasoning changes.

**Avoid by default**: full terminal output dumps, every intermediate thought, every web excerpt, redundantly copied context.
